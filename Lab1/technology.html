      <h2>Carbon Footprint Social Media App</h2>
      <p class="p">
        The idea behind this app is to use the popularity of social media in our society to prompt people to learn more
        about waste management and decrease their carbon footprint.
        Some may argue that there's no room for more social media, but look at TikTok and how much it has grown in
        the last few years.
        The app would allow people to view/follow their friends and family and share actions that they're doing to help lower their carbon footprint.
        For those significantly posting and gaining significant likes and follows, compensation is given just like influencers on TikTok. 
        This is a popular way to get more people aware of their carbon footprint and taking reputable action to help
